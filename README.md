# Java Date Class Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements a `Date` class in Java to represent dates and perform various operations, including sorting a list of `Date` objects. The class provides methods for validating dates, updating dates, calculating the difference between two dates, printing the date in a readable format, and sorting `Date` objects.

The project also includes a main class that demonstrates the usage of the `Date` class, handling invalid inputs and performing date-related operations.

## Features

- **Validation of Dates**: Ensures that the date is valid, considering leap years for February 29.
- **Date Update**: Allows updating a `Date` object with a new date, ensuring it's valid.
- **Day of the Week**: Calculates the day of the week for a given date.
- **Date Difference**: Calculates the difference in days between two dates.
- **Sorting**: Supports sorting a list of `Date` objects by year, month, and day.

## Files
